This Project was designed to be client facing. The client asked for a interative dashboard to give a summary of Janurary 2020 to October 2020 case data. Created Pivot tables to identify trends and relationships for 'time taken to close a case,' 'types of cases closed,' 'the best performing divisions' and revenue trends for the past 3 months. Noticed most cases were closed within the first week and the 2 most popular services offered by tge company was Absences and Probations.
#### Raw Data:
